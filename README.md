Task 1 involved QVI_transaction_data.xlsx and QVI_purchase_behaviour.csv as data sources

The primary task was to make strategic reccomendations to the category manager for the Chips department using their customer order data. The tasks involved included the following:

1. Creating and interpreting high level summaries of the data
2. Finding outliers and removing these (if applicable)
3. Checking data formats and correcting (if applicable)

The solution to task 1 can be found in Quantium_Task_1.ipynb


Task 2 involved QVI_data.xlsb as a data source.

The primary task was to to evaluate the performance of a store trial which was performed in stores 77, 86 and 88.

Considering the monthly sales experience of each store. We needed to analyze

1. total sales revenue
2. total number of customers
3. average number of transactions per customer

We want to test if total sales are significantly different in the trial period and if so, check if the driver of change is more purchasing customers or more purchases per customers etc.


Task 3 was to make a report in the form of a presentation to our client

The result of this can be found in Quantium_task_3.pptx
